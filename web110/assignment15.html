    Assignment 15
  </h1>
  <p>
The career that I chose to follow is to become a database administrator. In a way, I always liked to be a programmer and to engage with technology and the connections surrounding it, which led me to the world of 
    databases and how these are an important component of most of the functionalities in the Internet space and a backbone for companies and organizations that employs a lot of personell. My objective, as far as my 
    career goes, is to work for a data center company. One good example of a data center company is Equinix, and my goal is to work in one of their instalations in order to service customers that need servers, network 
    switches, and databases as secure as they can get.

    In Chapter 15, we learned about careers, the paths each one opens for those pursuing them, and the responsibilities, tasks, and skills they require. One of the first concepts that we learn throughout the chapter is 
    career management, which describes the active and purposeful management of a career by an individual and makes it an important aspect of a person's professional life. Of course, with career management comes also 
    the concept of career success, which may be measured by status, earnings, satisfaction, personal achievement, and personal values. 
While doing the assignments I got a taste of how my professional life may look on paper for resumes and CV purposes, from where I learned how to portray myself towards the professional environment that some websites 
    offer, like GitHub and LinkedIn, and how this has a major influence on how companies value my knowledge, experience and potential usefulness in their business. 
What I learned from the activities correlates very closely with the material that was presented in this chapter. For instance, we learn that job searching is the act of looking for employment, due to unemployment, 
    underemployment, discontent with a current position, or a desire for a better position; this concept was present while browsing some LinkedIn accounts, portraying their desire to be hired for a better position for 
    another company. Job seekers, as they are often called, research the employers to which they are applying. Some employers see evidence of this as a positive sign of enthusiasm for the position or the company, or as 
    a mark of thoroughness, from which they pay attention to what potential employers and recruiters find when they do their pre-interview information gathering about applicants. One of the most effective methods to 
    portray yourself and have a good chance of being hired into an important position is the use of networking, contacting as many people as possible to find a job due to personal connections.
