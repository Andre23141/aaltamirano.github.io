In Chapter 5 of the course, we were tasked with learning all about social media and its input into the fundamentals of how the Internet works, mainly because nowadays the traffic that goes through the Internet is being
massively carried by social media and the people that interact with it. Social media are computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, career interests, and other forms
of entertainment that can be spread and worked upon to create even more material for even more people. Now I will show you what I learned from the exercises and how can I apply that knowledge to the future. 
All the activities, in a nutshell, requires you to try and create new accounts on various social media platforms. They are intended for you to see what are the usual activities that you can do on them (some of them 
having "honeycomb framework elements" that enrich the experiences that each app offers and keep their users hooked to the social media platform) and these are some of the activities that are the most related to the 
social media sites that I like.
Youtube: This video-sharing platform already has content that is suitable for almost every preference. People often use it to watch videos to be entertained whether they are at lunch or busy with household tasks. 
You can also upload your content there.
Instagram: This social media platform is focused on artists and photographers alike, although it has video and image sharing of any type as well in order to appeal to the overall users. Is not as big as YouTube but it
has its ecosystem with its type of content and people interacting on it.
LinkedIn: This social media platform is focused on professionals, to share their curriculum vitae, their projects, and their professional lives for other people, or even entities, to see and interact with. It could be
an excellent tool to be noticed for your work and experience in your career.
