  In this module, we learned about the fundamentals of security. Some of the themes that we talked about during the reading section of this module were subjects like internet security, personally identifiable information, 
and the ethics of IT professionals. In a way, while doing the reading section before going into the assignments, most of the information presented was good online security practices that a heavy internet user would 
learn while surfing the web, mainly because most online scams don't work with younger people or IT professionals. From there, you can see how most of the activities done in this module can be considered a must for every 
individual who surfs on the Internet or interacts with any application connected to it. 
One of the assignments was to practice web browser safety. From here I learned how each of the most popular web browsers has a tutorial on how to have more control of your data: on how publicly available it can be, 
whether it can be used for personalized ads or not, and how to maintain your information secure and private while shopping online or creating accounts for services in the web.
Another assignment that caught my attention was the incentive to use anti-malware software. It is well known that these types of software services were created to help your computer get rid of malicious programs or 
files, but while doing the exercises I learned that the amount of bloatware that they bring with them kind of defeats the purpose of their original tasks themselves, making the computer work slower and most of the time
not even remediating the malware issue. In a way, the free antivirus software being offered online, whether they come from a reputable software company or not, are limited in their functionalities and they only work 
fully when a subscription is being paid and only remediate an issue that can be avoided in the first place by practicing online security and private data protection.
