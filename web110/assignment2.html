In this chapter, we learned about web browsers in general, and to get familiar with the internet fundamentals of how these tools work, their layout, and how they are useful to the end user we were presented with
various tasks, making us familiar with the different internet browser applications and how they work. It is well known that internet browsers are useful for us in general, to navigate the internet.
One of the things that I learned while doing the exercises presented to us in this chapter is that all the internet browsers share the same functionality, even with their unique layouts and even different color schemes. Some
of the shared functionalities include:
- Refresh button: This allows you to refresh the webpage to make it load correctly or check for changes in real time.
- Home button: A button that allows you to get into the home site for the browser (some browsers set their homepage as a search engine affiliated with the internet browser's company, but can be changed for another
webpage)
- Address, search, and status bar: These bars demonstrate the status of a webpage in the browser, allowing you to make changes, write URLs, and copy the current URL you're ubicated on.
One more thing that I learned about the exercises presented to us was the existence of browser extensions and add-ons, which from my point of view makes the experience of surfing the web and realizing tasks on it easier.
From here I learned that many plugins, add-ons, and extensions are useful in many important areas. Some can boost your internet security (like VPNs and authenticators) or even get you great deals before
checkout (Honey) but these are more prominent in chromium-based internet browsers. I would be putting a lot of the experiences that I experimented with doing those exercises in future projects because I feel that senior
individuals can benefit a lot from being taught the many browser's perks.
