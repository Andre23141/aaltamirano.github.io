  <h1>Assignment 11</h1>
  <p>

  In this module, we learned about graphics and multimedia, and how these can be used in a webpage with the use of the HTML code which allows you to play multimedia directly from your directory or even embed
  multimedia from other sources on the Internet. From the module, we also learned about the different types of multimedia, what they mean, and the effective way of using them in code.
First of all, we were taught about how two primary types of computer graphics exist: raster and vector. Raster graphics, composed of a grid of pixels, are resolution-dependent, meaning their quality degrades when 
    scaled up (this limitation is evident in the pixelation observed when enlarging a raster image). Conversely, vector graphics utilize mathematical equations to represent lines and shapes, rendering them 
    resolution-independent while filling the different shapes made by the vectors with color, making them look more cartoonish. 
One subject from this module that caught my attention was the evolution of multimedia, which is marked by increasing interactivity, blurring the line between passive consumption and active engagement. The 
    incorporation of haptic technology, which allows users to feel virtual objects, further enhances the immersive nature of it and allows for better experiences or more exact depictions of ficticious environments. 
    Future advancements promise even more profound experiences, potentially incorporating illusions of taste and smell which blurring the boundaries between the virtual and the real making full virtual reality 
    possible.
In conclusion, the study of computer graphics and multimedia has unveiled a dynamic and evolving landscape of digital creation and engagement. From raster and vector graphics to the immersiveness of multimedia, 
    this field proves to be an useful tool for web developers to make their pages more exciting to visit, capture the attention of possible customers and leave a good impression. In a way, this module made me 
    realize that there's still potential in web developer and how to make webpages look smarter, pretty and professional all at the same time.
