  While doing the activities on the Activities section on our Introduction chapter, we learned a bunch of basic knowledge regarding Internet, web applications, how to manage folders and its contents, how operating systems work,
and how to use various tools and platforms being available to us in the Internet to troubleshoot problems and to publish pieces of code. So far the basics were persented in order to be easier for us to do the various tasks
in the activities section. From all the activities done, I will like to point out three different aspect where I felt I got my knowledge expanded:
- The use of Git and TraceRoute: Tese tools available on the Internet are useful for tech savvy people in order to perform different tasks. For ne side, Git is the m popular Version Control System (or VSC) where you can
edit, share and scale your code with a team and makes it easier to spontaneously update the latest version of the code for everyone involved in it and, since it's distributed, if the system shuts down every team member still
hasa  copy of the code within their own machines, reducing the chances of a point of failure that could collapse the code entirely. On the other hand, TranceRoute is a command line utility that is used for troubleshooting
pruporses while diagnosing problems with the path that information packets use to travel through routers.
- Operating Systems: It was shown to us that there is three types of operating systems available for the public: Windows, Linux and macOS. Windows, being the most popular one, is the biggest and most recognizable mainly from
its use in the vast majority of computers, laptops, and even specific applications for enterprises such as aviation, data recolection, etc. Linux, on the other hand, is an open-source, community-driven operating system which
makes it possible to the end user to costumize it on a fundamental level, make various versions of it and share it with everyone, although one main disadvantage of it is the complicated use of the Terminal (which is essential
for Linux users) and how many aplications and pieces of hardware, more often than not, do not support their stuff to work with Linux. Lastly, macOS is the main operating system used by Macbooks and computers from Apple. They
have their own applications that mirrors the functionality of Windows applications and it exists in an "ecosystem" with other Apple devices which makes it easier to use and interact with each other.
- Basic uses for a computer: In this part I was refreshed with indications on how to manipulate files within your system, how to print documents and how to detect how a file is a video or a image or a piece of code.
