  While doing the activities in the Communications section of the Internet Fundamentals content I learned about Internet services, like file sharing and FTP, VoIP services, like calls and text over the technology of the Internet, and remote desktop software, like screen sharing and remote desktop environments. Since the activities encourage you to be hands-on with the services that the content is about, the amount of experience and understanding that you get over the concepts of this week's chapter gets internalized. You get to experiment and act upon said concepts, to a degree which you can help someone else with said applications and be more flexible while using existing and newer technology.
I've learned more about the protocols of file sharing and peer-to-peer file sharing than I did in a daily setting, mainly because you expect things to "just work" instead of thinking about the processes behind it, and it
could help me to guide other people on the reasons their files are not able to be shared, as well as recommending them the best practices to do so. While doing the assignments, especially the one that requires you to
research an application that would allow you to use a desktop remotely, I saw that the applications listed on the material weren't the best options for exploring remote desktop accessibilities. Because of that, I explored 
other options until I found TeamViewer. In fact, in the past, I used TeamViewer to be able to use my at the time broken cellphone, which had an unresponsive backlight (which made it unusable), and be able to create a
backup and protect my data until I could get a new cellphone. From there, I can say that I had some experiences with remote desktops, but definitely, the thing that I learned the most was the VoIP technology. VoIP allows
you to send texts and make calls over the Internet, which makes it convenient to get into contact with friends who, even though they live in a remote area, as long as they have Internet access it is possible to make a
call with them. I would use VoIP in the future, mainly because it is useful and I think is important for more people to know about the existence of that type of technology.
