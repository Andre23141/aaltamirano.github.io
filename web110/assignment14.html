  <h1>Assignment 14</h1>
  <p>
  Gantt Char for the Final Project
  </p>

  <p>
In Chapter 14, we learned about project management and the concepts that surround it. Project management is defined as a process of planning and overseeing a project from start to finish to achieve specific goals, 
    which makes it essential for businesses to expand, project future sales, and more. It involves five key phases: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing. 
One thing that stood out for me while doing the readings and activities is the constraints of project management, which are scope, time, budget, and quality. A project manager is responsible for ensuring the project 
    stays on track and meets its goals. These constraints are often interconnected, meaning a change in one often affects the others. I also learned that the project manager has to balance the constraints carefully to 
    ensure the project stays on track and schedule and that it can meet the goals of the company as effectively as possible.
It is worth mentioning the various aspects of the constraints for project management and what they mean:
- Scope: It refers to what the project is supposed to deliver. That is its goals, objectives, and specific deliverables. These can generate issues of the broadness of it or the quantity of changes being made to it.
- Time: It involves the project’s timeline, including deadlines and schedules. Delays can affect the project’s progress as well as stressing the managers responsable of it.
- Budget: This is the financial aspect, defining how much money is allocated for the project. Staying within budget is crucial, but it could cause a lack of quality in the project as well as overpricing if not 
    controlled.
- Quality: It ensures that the deliverables meet the required standards. If too much emphasis is placed on time or budget, the quality of the final product might suffer.
