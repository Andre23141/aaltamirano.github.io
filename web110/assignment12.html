  In this chapter, we looked at Javascript, more often abbreviated as JS, and how this important component of webpage design. Javascript is a high-level, interpreted programming language, and it serves as one of the 
    technologies of World Wide Web content engineering, making webpages interactive and providing online programs, including video games.
    One common misconception between the general public regarding Javascript is regarding this programming language as the same as Java, but aside of having a lot of similities, including language name, syntax, and 
    respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design as well as their intended uses. For starters, Javascript is used to add client-side behavior to HTML pages, as well as 
    being capable of including multimedia and graphics. 
    The way Javascript is imbedded into HTML pages is by the use of scripts, which in HTML code are represented by the use of <script> and they serve a purpose:
  - Loading new page content or submitting data to the server via Ajax without reloading the page.
  - Animation of page elements, including fade, zoom, resizing, etc
  - Interactive content, for example games, and playing audio and video.
  - Transmitting information about the user's reading habits and browsing activities to various websites, which nowadays various webpages use in order to put personalized ads in your feed while scrolling.
  There is one caveat of using Javascript and has to do with cybersecurity and this is because JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via 
  the Web. In order to deal with these, there are a few practices involved:
  - First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files
  - Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site.

  <script>
    
    // Name using id
    document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "Andre Altamirano";
    // Current date and time code
    function updateDateTime() {
      const now = new Date();
      const currentDateTime = now.toLocaleString();
      document.querySelector('#datetime').textContent = currentDateTime;
    }
    setInterval(updateDateTime, 1000);
    // Canvas text
    var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
    ctx.font = "30px Arial";
    ctx.fillText("Andre Altamirano",10,50);
    // Canvas imagery
    var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas1");
    var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(95, 50, 40, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    ctx.stroke();

    var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas1");
    var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
    ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
    ctx.lineTo(200, 100);
    ctx.stroke();
