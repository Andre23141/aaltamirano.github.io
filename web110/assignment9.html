  In this module, we looked at CSS, a useful tool for customizing and styling webpages around the Internet. In a way, CSS is part of a whole that configures and customizes websites and their inner workings, mainly 
interacting with HTML but also Javascript and their respective code. By using all three, you can do pretty much everything when creating a website and can assign different values or give properties to buttons or headers.
Still, CSS is in charge of the colors and schemes of the website which is important for its clarity and attractiveness. During this chapter, we were presented with exercises to familiarize ourselves with the concept of 
CSS and what its utilities are, and from there I learned some key concepts:
One of the exercises was to create and use internal CSS. What I learned from the exercise is how malleable CSS code is, and how key it is to understand its logic and syntax to squeeze the most that you can from that 
piece of code, which is going to be in charge of how a website looks outside from the contents, multimedia and hyperlinks. In a way, it sharpens your understanding of how important that piece of code is and how important
its impact on websites is.
The other exercise that I did was the creation and use of external CSS. What I learned from this exercise is how interchangeable and adaptable CSS can be while being integrated with the main HTML code. In a way, 
it shows us how different libraries are accessible to us and how different website styles are available for everyone to use and test to check which styles match the best with the programmer (and sometimes even customers) 
which makes it flexible and highly customizable. 
In summary, CSS is an excellent part of code that puts the website together and makes it readable and presentable.
