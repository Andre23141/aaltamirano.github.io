Chapter 4 is dedicated to the works and functionality of email. In summary, email is a communication method that uses electronic devices to deliver messages across computer networks, and nowadays, it is available for
widespread public use with the development of email client software. While doing the exercises shown in this chapter, we were familiarized with said client software (that is accessible through your internet browser or a
client software application) and we learned how to work with them. For the most part, I was already familiar with the functionalities that email client software offers, but it is worth mentioning what I learned in the
process.

While sending, receiving, and responding to emails, I got familiarized with forwarding messages sent to me to a different individual. In some email clients (at least in the one that was using, Gmail) there is an option
to forward said messages to other destinations, which makes it easy to share with anyone you need information sent by email originally meant for you. I got to apply this a few times, to share ticket shows and important
notices in my workplace. Other concepts that I learned while doing the exercises are email spoofing and disposable email addresses, where email spoofing refers to the process of creating email messages with a forged
email address, and disposable email addresses are just email addresses that can not be harvested. While doing the exercise of viewing message headers, and regarding the concept of preventing email spoofing, I learned
that by verifying that the message was sent by the displayed "from:" in the email message, I can safeguard myself from accidentally clicking a link that could lead into a malicious website, and be a phishing victim in
the process.

In conclusion, although I consider myself to be knowledgeable of the email client functions and processes, I learned that you should be more careful about where certain email comes from, mainly because it could be of a
malicious precedence.
