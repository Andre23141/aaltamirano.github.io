  In this last week, while doing my final project, I decided to make it about what I learned regarding web design. In a summary, I compiled some basic concepts from HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to portray them
    using a fresh-built webpage (alongside props obtained from both this course as well as external ones) and showcasing them alongside my PowerPoint presentation in the video. The resources portrayed in the video are:
    <ul> HTML basics
      <li>Which stands forÂ HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web pages.</li>
      <li>It provides the structure of web content and is essential for displaying text, images, links, and other multimedia elements in a web browser. It achieves this using tags in its code, like h1, p and some other 
        tags that embody other important aspects of web design, like script and style</li>
      <li>HTML is a crucial component of web development, serving as the backbone for creating and structuring content on the internet.</li>
    </ul>
<ul>CSS basics
  <li>Color: The color property specifies the foreground color of text within an element. It can accept various color format.</li>
  <li>Text align: The text-align property controls the horizontal alignment of text within a block element.</li>
  <li>Background color: The background-color property sets the background color of an element. Similar to the color property, it can accept color names, hexadecimal values, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA.</li>
  <li>Margin: The margin property creates space around elements, outside of any defined borders. It can be set for all four sides (top, right, bottom, left)</li>
</ul>
  <ul> Javascript basics
    <li>Functions in JavaScript are also objects, meaning they can have properties and methods. This allows you to assign additional data to functions, enhancing their functionality.</li>
    <li>JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. This allows for property and method inheritance, enabling objects to share functionality.</li>
  </ul>
