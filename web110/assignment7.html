 In Chapter 7 we learned about everything related to networking, related to computer networks, protocols, and the inner workings of the DNS. We also learned about the hardware that makes it possible, like twisted-pair cables and optical fiber. In a way, it was 
essential for me to understand how to do the projects and assignments in the chapter summary because the materials behind it are uncomprehensible if you read it alone. However, as soon as you get to interact with those concepts with real examples it gets easier to 
understand and the content becomes digestible. 
One of the exercises prompted me to review my IP address settings in both Windows and Mac (the most used operating systems out there) which made me realize how helpful that could be, mainly to raise awareness on how IP addresses should be taken seriously and they can 
affect the security around. In a way, it let me know how important it is to know the different IP configurations across multiple devices, and it could help in my career mainly in the subject of knowing the different network configurations with Mac devices, where it 
also shows you le level of connectivity across multiple points of contact like the contact with ISP, Ethernet or your router.

The other exercise was about checking our Internet connectivity, again in multiple devices and operating systems. In a way, I knew from previous experiences how to check the level of connectivity of my Wi-Fi network and I knew how to troubleshoot devices like the 
router, but from this exercise, I learned how to execute the command "ipconfig" and how to ping towards different servers in the Internet. From this, I could apply it in my future career by using these types of checks and system preferences in order to improve 
Internet connectivity (mainly Wi-Fi) and addresses where the connectivity originates.
