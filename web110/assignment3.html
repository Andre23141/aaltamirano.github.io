  In this chapter, we learned about search engines, how they work, and a few steps to keep yourself secure while browsing on the Internet thanks to said engines.
While doing the activities I learned some properties that surround search engines that could be useful for the everyday user, as well as students like me. For starters, one of the very first assignments to do was to 
compare search engines. We all know about Google and, to an extent, Bing. Still, while doing this exercise I discovered one that may have more optimal searches, especially since Google got complacent and started implementing
advertisements on their search results. For example, DuckDuckGo is considered the most private search engine outside of Tor.
One more thing that I learned while doing the exercises is how to identify safe webpages to navigate to while making use of the search engines, knowledge that could be useful for senior Internet users as well as a fair
warning for all users to be aware of, mainly because these sites are used to do phishing.
Lastly, I learned about ChatGPT and its capabilities. To understand the fundamentals of how ChatGPT works, you have to know that this type of technology, new at the same level as advanced, is not yet perfected and still
has flaws that completely defeat the objective of the platform, even so I have learned how this technology It has enormous potential mainly for search engines like Google. Today some users already receive results in 
the form of AI when they search for anything on Google, and this is being done to promote the use of AI while obtaining information about how it works and how it helps.
Overall, search engines are still well into development thanks to IA but most of the stuff covered in this chapter, like search criteria, different types of search engines, and their various implementations, are still useful.
